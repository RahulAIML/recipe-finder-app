## Interview Talking Points

1. **Component Structure**:
   - `App`: Main container component that manages state
   - `IngredientInput`: Handles user input for ingredients
   - `RecipeList`: Displays a grid of recipe cards
   - `RecipeCard`: Individual recipe display component

2. **State Management**:
   - Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management
   - Manages ingredients list and recipes data

3. **API Integration**:
   - Fetches recipes from TheMealDB API
   - Implements debouncing to prevent excessive API calls

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Responsive design using Material-UI Grid
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Interactive ingredient tags

## Future Improvements

- Add recipe details modal
- Implement user authentication to save favorite recipes
- Add filters (meal type, cuisine, diet restrictions)
- Include cooking time and difficulty level
- Add pagination for search results
